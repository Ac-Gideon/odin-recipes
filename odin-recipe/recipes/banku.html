<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In Ghanaian cusine, banku is a swallow dish made of a slightly fermented cooked mixture of corn and cassava doughs
    formed into single-servings balls.Banku is cooked in hot water until it turns into a smooth,whitish paste,served
    with okra stew,soup or a pepper sauce with fish.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Corn dough</li>
    <li>Cassava dough</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Thoroughly wash your hands before you begin to prepare the meal.</li>
    <li>Mix the corn dough with the cassava dough in a pot. Mix and mash the dough to form a smooth paste as you ensure
        that you remove all the fibre pieces and the lumps.
    </li>
    <li>Using your hands, continue mixing until the dough form a paste-like mixture. When it gains an extremely smooth
        consistency, add a pinch of salt.
    </li>
    <li>Place the pot with mixture on medium heat fire and stir gently using a wooden stirrer(Bankuta). Continue
        stirring gently until the paste begins to thicken.
    </li>
    <li>The mixture will continue to get thicker and thicker with time such that it begins to gather at bottom of the
        wooden stirrer. At this point, you will be required to add more force as it is getting harder.
    </li>
    <li>Lower the heat and using sackcloth or a napkin, hold the pot in one place and use a wooden stirrer to beat
        through the mixture. Continue with the beating for roughly six minutes as you make brief stops in between the
        beating.
    </li>
    <li>Create some perforations on the thick mass using the wooden stirrer and add water. Increase the fire, cover the
        pot and leave it for around 10 to 15 minutes to cook thoroughly.
    </li>
    <li>Check on the mixture to make sure that the water does not dry up completely. Repeat the process of kneading
        until you achieve the smoothness of your choice.
    </li>
    <li>When it gains the smoothness you prefer, take a smaller bowl and use it to shape it into you desired serving
        shapes and sizes.
    </li>
    <li>Enjoy with your preferred fish,sauce or soup.</li>
